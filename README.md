# IoT final project

Code running on Ubuntu system, base on C and Greenwaves libraries.

**Objective：**
•	Master the multi-core usage of low-power development boards (GAP8)
•	Understand the basic neural network structure
•	Learn how to analyze the performance

**Marking Criteria:**
•	Master GAP8 multi-core control (run different functions on different cores)
•	Realize a simple neural network
•	Implement the neural network on GAP8
•	Use simulated data for training and prediction
•	Performance analysis of GAP8 (cycles, frequency, time… Please find the attached document)

**Bonus:** 
•	Use flex sensor data as training and test data 
•	Multi-core asynchronous control, such as training on core1, generating random prediction data sets on core2, and implementing the prediction function on core3...
